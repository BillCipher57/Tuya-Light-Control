## Tuya-Light-Control - By Sanware Technologies

A simple python program that allows one to control a Tuya device.

## Setup

To set this up, you simply need to download the repo, and then head to the 'config.py' file. In which you will find four variables.
Those variables, listed
USERNAME, PASSWORD, COUNTRY_CODE, and light_id need to be filled in order for this program to send a signal to the Tuyapy API.
Once filled, simply save the config.py file, and activate the Light_Control.py program (if via terminal then ensure config and light control are in the same directory.)

From there, the Tkinter GUI will allow you to control your light's colour and power.
